   <section class="pp col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-11"><h2 id="col1">Guitar</h2><br><p> The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the finger(s)/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar).</p></section>
  <section class="pp col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-11"><h2 id="col2">Violin</h2><br><p>The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments exist, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused. The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings.<br></p></section>
   <section class="pp col-lg-3 col-md-11 col-sm-11"><h2 id="col3">Piano</h2><br><p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard,[1] which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.<br><br><br></p></section>
